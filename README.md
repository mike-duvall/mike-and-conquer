# mike-and-conquer


This project is a reimplementation of the original 1995 Command and Conquer RTS game.  I'm doing this as a personal project for my own enjoyment and education.  I don't currently have any plans to open this up as an open source project for others to contribute to.

This project is being implemented using Monogame and C# with Visual Studio 2022 as the IDE

Testing is done via an external test project, mike-and-conquer-test

In general, the intent of this project is to exactly re-implement the original game, with few if any changes to gameplay or behavior.   One big exception to that, however, is the AI.  My intent with the AI is implement an AI opponent that beat me. (Which seems like a reasonable challenge, since I'm only an average player)

The current state of the code varies.  Some of code is pretty high quality that I'm proud of and is in a good state, while some of it has been temporarily slapped together to work for now but is need of refactoring and improvement.  My planned end state is to get all of the code in pristine state, but it's not there yet


Here is screenshot of current state:
